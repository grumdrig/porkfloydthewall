================

Chunk duplicator for Minecraft. Builds a square wall around 0,0 and a
radius you specify, based on a prototype chunk at X, Z. (These
coordinates are chunk coordinates; chunks are 16m x 16m.)

DO NOT USE this on a world you care about. Causes some idiosyncratic
behavior. This is a work in progress.


EXAMPLE

$ java BuildWall
Usage: java BuildWall SAVEGAMEPATH X Z RADIUS
Duplicate chunk at <X,Z> around <0,0> at RADIUS
Don't do this while Minecraft is running

$ java BuildWall ~/Library/Application\ Support/minecraft/saves/Herobrine/ 0 0 5

$ open /Applications/Minecraft.app
